# Flow Chart for Statistical Tests
This flow chart helps you choose the right statistical test to evaluate your experiments based on the type of data you have, its underlying distribution and assumptions as well as the number of groups and confounding variables you are testing. 

[A/B/n Testing Flow Chart](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ktaDHWU=/)

There are additional notes/formulas for the tests underneath many tests. The color coding helps to group similar tests and the different outlines help to call out parallel tests for different assumptions.

I've also listed out useful resources on the right of the flow chart as well as included references in the description boxes at the bottom for learning more about these statistical tests.

Please file suggestions/issues by creating a pull request or if you would rather give me feedback via email, feel free to do so using p.leonova@gmail.com.
